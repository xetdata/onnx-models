# T5

## Use-cases
Transformer-based language model trained on multiple tasks including summarization, sentiment-analysis, q&a, translation etc.
The implementation in this repo is an adaptation of the [onnxt5 repo](https://github.com/abelriboulot/onnxt5) which makes the export and use of T5 with ONNX easier.

## Description
[T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) is a transformer model which aims to provide great flexibility and provide better semantic
understanding through the training of multiple tasks at once.

### Source
Huggingface PyTorch T5 + script changes ==> ONNX T5-encoder

Huggingface PyTorch T5 + script changes ==> ONNX T5-decoder-with-lm-head

Script changes include:
 - reshaping the Huggingface models to combine the lm head with the decoder to allow for a unified model
 - reshaping the encoder to output the hidden state directly

## Inference
The script for ONNX model conversion and ONNX Runtime inference is [here](dependencies/T5-export.py).
More complete utilities to export and use the models are maintained in the [onnxt5 repo](https://github.com/abelriboulot/onnxt5).

### Input to model
This implementation takes as inputs a prompt which begins by the task at hand here. Examples of some tasks include ```summarize: <PROMPT>```,
```translate English to French: <PROMPT>```, ```cola sentence: <PROMPT>```, etc.
For the full list of task you can refer to the appendix D of the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).


### Preprocessing steps
The easiest way to use the model is to use the onnxt5 utilities (installation instructions: ```pip install onnxt5```).

In that case you can use the model with the following piece of code:
```python
from onnxt5 import GenerativeT5
from onnxt5.api import get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer
decoder_sess, encoder_sess, tokenizer = get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer()
generative_t5 = GenerativeT5(encoder_sess, decoder_sess, tokenizer, onnx=True)
prompt = 'translate English to French: I was a victim of a series of accidents.'
output_text, output_logits = generative_t5(prompt, max_length=100, temperature=0.)
# output_text: "J'ai été victime d'une série d'accidents."
```

Or if you wish to produce the embeddings of a sentence:
```python
from onnxt5.api import get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer, run_embeddings_text

decoder_sess, encoder_sess, tokenizer = get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer()
prompt = 'Listen, Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.'
encoder_embeddings, decoder_embeddings = run_embeddings_text(encoder_sess, decoder_sess, tokenizer, prompt)
```

Otherwise you can manually create the Generative model with the following:

```python
from onnxruntime import InferenceSession
from transformers import T5Tokenizer
from .dependencies.models import GenerativeT5

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-base')

# Start from ORT 1.10, ORT requires explicitly setting the providers parameter if you want to use execution providers
# other than the default CPU provider (as opposed to the previous behavior of providers getting set/registered by default
# based on the build flags) when instantiating InferenceSession.
# For example, if NVIDIA GPU is available and ORT Python package is built with CUDA, then call API as following:
# InferenceSession(path/to/model, providers=['CUDAExecutionProvider'])
decoder_sess = InferenceSession(str(path_t5_decoder))
encoder_sess = InferenceSession(str(path_t5_encoder))
generative_t5 = GenerativeT5(encoder_sess, decoder_sess, tokenizer, onnx=True)
generative_t5('translate English to French: I was a victim of a series of accidents.', 21, temperature=0.)[0]
```

### Output of model
For the T5-encoder model:

**last_hidden_state**: Sequence of hidden-states at the last layer of the model. It's a float tensor of size (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size).

For T5-decoder-with-lm-head model:

**logit_predictions**: Prediction scores of the language modeling head. It's a float tensor of size (batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size).

### Postprocessing steps
For the T5-encoder model:

```python
last_hidden_states = model(input_ids)[0]
```

For the T5-decoder-with-lm-head model:

```python
# To generate the encoder's last hidden state
encoder_output = encoder_sess.run(None, {"input_ids": input_ids})[0]
# To generate the full model's embeddings
decoder_output = decoder_sess.run(None, {
                                        "input_ids": input_ids,
                                        "encoder_hidden_states": encoder_output
    })[0]
```

For the generative model, to generate a translation:
```
from onnxt5 import GenerativeT5
from onnxt5.api import get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer
decoder_sess, encoder_sess, tokenizer = get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer()
generative_t5 = GenerativeT5(encoder_sess, decoder_sess, tokenizer, onnx=True)
prompt = 'translate English to French: I was a victim of a series of accidents.'
output_text, output_logits = generative_t5(prompt, max_length=100, temperature=0.)
```

## Dataset (Train and validation)
The original model from Google Brain is pretrained on the [Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4).
The pretrained model is referenced in [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/transformers/modeling_t5.py), trained on the same data.
