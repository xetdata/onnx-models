# How to Contribute to the Model Zoo

To contribute a new model, create a [pull request](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/new/). A pre-defined pull request [template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) is loaded when creating a new pull request, which describes all the artifacts required for making the contribution.

View an [example submission](vision/classification/resnet/README.md) to get a sense of the final output.
